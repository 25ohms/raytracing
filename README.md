- This is purely educational. I am doing this synchronously with OpenGL so that I can learn about methods of forward and backward rendering.
- Following the tutorial from [Raytracing In One Weeked](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html), using CMake and C++17 instead of C++11.

## Image generation instruction
```
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
build/app > image.ppm
```
```
```
```
